# Lending_Club_Case_Study
This case study try to identify the customer behaviour and to minimize financial risk when lending to customers.

## Problem Statement
## Introduction 
This case study aims to provide insights into solving business problem through exploratory data analysis (EDA), focusing on risk analytics in banking and financial services. It highlights how data is used to minimize financial risk when lending to customers.

## Business Understanding
You are working for a consumer finance company that lends various types of loans to urban customers. The company must decide on loan approvals based on applicants' profiles, facing two main risks:

Not approving a loan may result in lost business if the applicant can repay.
Approving a loan may lead to financial loss if the applicant is likely to default.
The dataset includes information on past loan applicants, indicating whether they defaulted. The goal is to identify patterns that predict loan defaults, which can guide decisions like denying loans, reducing loan amounts, or adjusting interest rates for risky applicants.

Decision Scenarios: When a loan is applied for, the company can either:

Approve the Loan:
Fully paid: The applicant repays the loan completely.
Current: The applicant is still paying installments.
Charged-off: The applicant defaults on the loan.
Reject the Loan: No data is available for these applicants since they did not proceed with the loan.

## Business Objectives
As the largest online loan marketplace, the company seeks to minimize credit loss, which occurs when borrowers default on loans. The aim is to identify risky applicants labeled as 'charged-off' to reduce potential losses.

By understanding the key variables influencing loan defaults, the company can enhance its risk assessment and portfolio management. Additionally, conducting independent research on risk analytics is recommended to deepen your understanding of the relevant variables and their significance.
